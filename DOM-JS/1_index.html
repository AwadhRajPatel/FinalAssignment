1. Explain the DOM and its role in Web development

The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the document as a tree-like structure, where each node represents a different part of the document.

Role of DOM in Web Development:

Manipulation: JavaScript can access and manipulate the DOM, allowing developers to dynamically change the content, style, and structure of web pages.
Event Handling: Event listeners can be attached to DOM elements, triggering specific JavaScript code when events occur (like clicks, mouse hovers, or form submissions).
User Interaction: The DOM enables interactive web pages by allowing JavaScript to respond to user input and actions.
Accessibility: The DOM helps developers ensure web pages are accessible to users with disabilities by providing a structured way to represent content.
