<!-- 
What is Event Delegation?
 Event delegation is a technique in JavaScript where you leverage the event bubbling mechanism to handle events at a higher
 level in the DOM rather than assigning individual event listeners to each target element. By attaching a single event 
 listener to a parent element, you can manage events for multiple child elements, even those added dynamically after 
 the event listener was attached.

How Does Event Delegation Work?

 When an event occurs on an element, it first triggers handlers on that element, and then (due to event bubbling) the
 event propagates up through its ancestors. Event delegation takes advantage of this bubbling process. Instead of 
 adding an event listener to each individual element, you add one to a common ancestor that listens for events on
  its descendants.

  Benefits of Event Delegation

   1.Performance Improvement: Reduces the number of event listeners, which can improve performance, especially when dealing with a large number of elements.
   2.Simplified Code: Makes your code cleaner and easier to manage by reducing duplication.
   3.Dynamic Elements Handling: Allows you to handle events on elements that are added to the DOM dynamically after the initial page load.
