What is the addEventListener Method?

The addEventListener method in JavaScript is used to attach event handlers to DOM elements. 
It allows you to specify a function (event handler) that will be called whenever a specified
event occurs on the target element. This method is a crucial part of event handling in the DOM, as it
provides a flexible and powerful way to respond to user interactions, such as clicks, key presses, form submissions, and more.

Why Use addEventListener?

1.Multiple Event Handlers: 
Unlike older methods like onclick, which overwrite any existing event handlers, addEventListener allows you to add multiple event listeners to a single element for the same event.

2.Event Options: 
It provides options to control how the event is handled, such as whether it should be captured during the capturing phase, and whether it should be passive (not preventing default actions).

3.Flexibility: 
It supports a wide range of event types and can be used with any DOM element.
