Explain the difference between npm and npx using the create-react-app code example
npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. 
It is used to install and manage packages for your project.

npx is a command-line tool that is part of npm, and it allows you to execute packages without having to install them globally. This makes it more convenient to use packages that are only needed for a specific task.
Create-React-App example:


Install Create React App globally using npm:

bash

Verify
Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code

npm install -g create-react-app
Use npx to create a new React application:

bash

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit

Copy code
npx create-react-app my-app

In this example, npx executes the create-react-app package to create a new React project without having to install it globally. This is because npx will automatically download and install the package in the current project directory, making it available only for this project.
